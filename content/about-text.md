### About FrontendCrumbs

Hey, I’m Hami, a front-end Vue.js developer, and I created FrontendCrumbs to share what I’ve learned along the way.

I’m all about UI/UX—creating clean, intuitive designs that make a real impact. FrontendCrumbs is a place for developers who want practical, framework-agnostic solutions for building better user interfaces.

No fluff, just helpful resources to make your front-end journey a little easier. Whether you’re diving into new UI/UX concepts or just need a fresh perspective, this is the spot.

I’m here to share what works, what doesn’t, and how to keep improving. Stick around and let’s craft better interfaces together.

_Crafting Perfect UI/UX, One Crumb at a Time._
